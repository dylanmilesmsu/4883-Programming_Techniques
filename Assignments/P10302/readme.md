Solution code to https://onlinejudge.org/index.php?option=onlinejudge&Itemid=8&page=show_problem&category=0&problem=1243

First thing I did was ignore the math and try to work from the input to the output. Got something that worked for the input provided but rejected from uvaonline. 
That's when I realized it only worked because the input was 1 2 3
and that i neede do go 1 2 3 ... X no matter what the input was
after that it was super easy.. 
except I started having negative numbers and needed unsigned long long int i guess
then it worked
